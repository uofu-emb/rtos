Topics covered include: timing requirements, low power modes and energy efficiency, concurrency, distributed communication using CAN bus, system testing and verification.

## Course Outcomes

At the end of this course, you should:

- Be able to build
    - safe and fault tolerant system
    - real-time systems
    - distributed systems.
    - concurrent systems
    - low-power systems
- Work in an industry environment:
    - Setup a project from scratch
    - Write automated tests.
    - Use source control.
    - Review code.
    - Modify existing code base.

See here for [full detailed learning objectives.](learning-objectives.pdf)

## Class format
- 5 minute case study presentation
- 20 minute discussion
- Remaining time working in the lab in pairs.

## Tooling
We will be using [Raspberry Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) toolchain to provide OS, HAL, and libraries. We will be using [FreeRTOS](htts://www.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/01-Task-creation/00-TaskHandle).

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE. Most of the time we will be operating on the **command line**.

I recommend you use a Linux machine if possible. Linux is what you will be using in the industry, you need to be comfortable with it.

## Materials

You will need to purchase **two** Picos from the ECE stockroom (MEB 2355).

You will also need to purchase a CAN transceiver module from the stockroom later in the semester.

Total cost should be less than $15.

## Cheating and ethics

__We learn good practice by seeing good practice.__

__We learn good practice by critiquing bad practice.__

This is a collaborative course, you are not just encouraged but required to work together!

- What is not cheating:
    - Reading examples on the internet.
    - Working with other students
    - Reading other student's code.
    - Helping debug
    - Working with people from outside class.
- What is cheating:
    - Copying code without understanding it.

Labs include a reference implementation which you may find useful.

If you do find a code snippet, example online, or read the reference implementation - I recommend you type it into your code rather than copy and paste. This will make you engage with the code and give a better understanding.

Students are expected to maintain the ethical and professional standards of the engineering discipline. Show respect for one another. For more information see the University Policies section below.

## Attendance & Punctuality

This is a collaborative and lab based course. Students are required to attend each class and participate. Please let me know as soon as possible if you cannot come to class. If you are sick, stay home!

## Course Policies

Instructor will respond to emails within 24 hours.

Students are expected to complete code reviews within **3 business days of being assigned**. Students should make arrangements with lab partners to meet outside of class time if required.

Note that you are working in pairs, and a choice to abandon an assignment affects your partner.
# Assignments

## Safety case study with presentation
Each student is assigned a short, 5 minute presentation. This presentation will cover a case study of a critical failure of an embedded system. The case could come from any situation, including medical devices, transportation, industrial control, and home automation.  The presentation should discuss the consequences of the failure, the root causes, and what could have been done to prevent or mitigate the failure. At the beginning of class, one student will give their presentation.
## Labs
Labs are broken into several components. You must complete all components of the lab.
- Pre-lab primer
    - The pre-lab also includes introductory material. This may include videos and articles to review before class.
    - The pre-lab includes a set of questions. Students will submit their answers on Canvas the day before class.
- Lab coding activities
    - All lab activities will be done in pairs (if an odd number of students is present, one team will have three members).
    - The instructor and TA will be present for the entire lab session to discuss and provide feedback.
    - Each lab includes a set of activities with explanatory introduction. All activities are intended to yield unit tests that validate the outcome of the activity.
- Post-lab reflection survey
    - A post-lab survey is given. This helps the students evaluate their own performance and gives the instructor an opportunity to evaluate the outcomes of the lab.
    - The survey is administered on Canvas.
- Code review
    - When all activities are complete, the team will create a pull request (PR). Each team will be paired with another team. Each team will be responsible for doing code review for the other team. In order to pass the code review, all unit tests must pass. The reviewers should verify the code  completes all the requirements of the lab. The team should also review for style, organization, and clarity. If changes are necessary, the team can make the changes and resubmit for review.
    - In order to complete the lab, students must pass their own code review. They must also complete their assigned review. One unavoidable problem of the review process is that control is given to another party during review. It is the team's responsibility to ensure the reviewing team finishes the review. Badgering your colleague to finish reviewing your PR is a fact of life in industry practice. If needed, the instructor can help resolve any conflicts.

It is expected that students adhere to University of Utah policies regarding academic honesty, including but not limited to refraining from cheating, plagiarizing, misrepresenting one's work, and/or inappropriately collaborating. This includes the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools without citation, documentation, or authorization. Students are expected to adhere to the prescribed professional and ethical standards of the profession/discipline for which they are preparing. Any student who engages in academic dishonesty or who violates the professional and ethical standards for their profession/discipline may be subject to academic sanctions as per the University of Utah’s [Student Code](https://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-410.php)
- **Drop/Withdrawal Policies**. Students may drop a course within the first two weeks of a given semester without any penalties. Students may officially withdraw (W) from a class or all classes after the drop deadline through the midpoint of a course. A “W” grade is recorded on the transcript and appropriate tuition/fees are assessed. The grade “W” is not used in calculating the student’s GPA. For deadlines to withdraw from full-term, first, and second session classes, see the U's Academic Calendar.
