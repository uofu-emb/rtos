# Lab 6. Scheduling

## Learning objectives.
Evaluate production/consumption ratio to prevent overflow.
Classify timing requirements as hard, firm, or soft real-time requirements
Prioritize tasks based on timing requirements.
Identify cases of priority inversion.
Identify the difference between cooperative and preemptive prioritization.
Identify reschedule points in the operating system.
Analyze and select scheduling algorithms based on their ability to meet real-time requirements
Build systems that meet hard timing requirements.

## Pre-lab

## Lab

### Setup
You'll need to add these config files.

zephyr/app.overlay
```
&usart2 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-0 = < &usart2_tx_pa2 &usart2_rx_pa3 &usart2_cts_pa0 &usart2_rts_pa1 >;
    current-speed = < 0x1c200 >;
};

/ {
    soc {
        usart3: serial@40004800 {
            compatible = "st,stm32-usart", "st,stm32-uart";
            reg = <0x40004800 0x400>;
            clocks = <&rcc STM32_CLOCK_BUS_APB1 0x00040000>;
            interrupts = <29 0>;
            status = "okay";
            label = "UART_3";
            pinctrl-0 = < &usart3_cts_pb13 &usart3_rts_pb14 &usart3_tx_pb10 &usart3_rx_pb11 >;
			current-speed = < 0x1c200 >;
        };
    };
};
```

zephyr/prj.conf
```
CONFIG_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y
CONFIG_NUM_METAIRQ_PRIORITIES=1
CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS=y
CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS_USE_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y
```

When you create supervisor threads, you will need to set the priority to a Meta-IRQ level, which forces the thread to always preempt others. The priority should be set to `-CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES`.

https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.5/reference/kernel/threads/index.html#meta-irq-priorities

To measure the runtime of threads, the runtime statistics can be gathered with timing functions. Of particular interest are `k_thread_runtime_stats_all_get` and `k_thread_runtime_stats_get`. Other timing functions are available that may be useful.

https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.5/reference/kernel/threads/index.html#runtime-statistics

https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.5/reference/timing_functions/index.html

When dealing with indeterminate data in tests due to variations in runtime, you may need to test bounded ranges.

Systick is currently set a 1000Hz.

### Activity 0
Induce priority inversion.

1. create two preemptable threads (and a supervisor to manage them).
1. create a semaphore shared between the two.
1. set one to higher priority. set it to delay start.
1. have the lower priority thread acquire the semphore first.
1. verify that the high priority thread will not execute.

You may find it useful to create a helper function to setup and teardown the threads.

### Activity 1
In this activity, you'll create two competing threads that use the following functions
```
void busy_busy(char *name)
{
    for (int i = 0; ; i++);
}

void busy_yield(char *name)
{
    for (int i = 0; ; i++) {
        if (!(i & 0xFF)) {
            k_yield();
        }
    }
}
```
Write tests for two threads running the following scenarios. Try to predict the runtime for each thread.
1. Threads with same priority:
    1. Coop
        1. Both run `busy_busy`.
        1. Both run `busy_yield`
    1. Preempt
        1. Both run `busy_busy`.
        1. Both run `busy_yield`
1. Threads with different priority.
    1. Coop
        1. Both run `busy_busy`.
            1. Higher priority starts first.
            1. Lower priority starts first.
        1. Both run `busy_yield`
            1. Higher priority starts first.
            1. Lower priority starts first.
    1. Preempt
        1. Both run `busy_busy`.
            1. Higher priority starts first.
            1. Lower priority starts first.
        1. Both run `busy_yield`
            1. Higher priority starts first.
            1. Lower priority starts first.

Make sure you are setting priorities according to the priority order presented in the documentation.

### Activity 2

```
void busy_sleep(char *name)
{
    k_busy_wait(10000);
    k_sleep(K_MSEC(490));
}
```
1. Write tests for two threads: one should run `busy_sleep` and the other `busy_yield`
1. Predict the share of the runtime for each of the threads.
