# Lab 8 Networking
## Learning objectives:

* Use the CAN bus to share data between nodes.
* Identify the failure mode of a babbling CAN node
* Identify different network topologies
* Identify the electric characteristics of the CAN wiring
* Describe the properties of CAN that allow prioritization, error handling, and multiple bus members acting at the same time
* Identify the components of the CAN bus framing.
* Setup CAN message processing using an interrupt.
* Setup CAN message processing using a work queue.
* Send a message over the CAN bus.
* Apply the 8 fallacies of distributed computing.

# Lab
Add the CAN library submodule (note this is a fork with some fixes)  https://github.com/uofu-emb/can2040

Many microcontrollers include dedicated CAN hardware peripherals, but the Pico does not.
The Pico has a neat feature called programmable I/O (PIO), which allows you to implement high efficiency state machines in hardware.
It can be used to implement peripherals that don't have a dedicated hardware peripheral.
This open-source library implements a CAN controller using the PIO system.

## Activity
This activity will establish sending and receiving messages. You can use this template, modified from the API docs.

```
#include <can2040.h>
#include <hardware/regs/intctrl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pico/stdlib.h>

static struct can2040 cbus;

static void can2040_cb(struct can2040 *cd, uint32_t notify, struct can2040_msg *msg)
{
    // Put your code here....
}

static void PIOx_IRQHandler(void)
{
    can2040_pio_irq_handler(&cbus);
}

void canbus_setup(void)
{
    uint32_t pio_num = 0;
    uint32_t sys_clock = 125000000, bitrate = 500000;
    uint32_t gpio_rx = 4, gpio_tx = 5;

    // Setup canbus
    can2040_setup(&cbus, pio_num);
    can2040_callback_config(&cbus, can2040_cb);

    // Enable irqs
    irq_set_exclusive_handler(PIO0_IRQ_0, PIOx_IRQHandler);
    irq_set_priority(PIO0_IRQ_0, PICO_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIORITY - 1);
    irq_set_enabled(PIO0_IRQ_0, 1);

    // Start canbus
    can2040_start(&cbus, sys_clock, bitrate, gpio_rx, gpio_tx);
}
```

1. Wire up CAN transceiver to your boards. In the example code RX/TX is on GPIO 4/5 - any GPIO is valid.
1. On one board, create a function that sends a message periodically using `can2040_transmit`
1. On another board, register a callback with `can_callback_config` to receive and log the messages.
1. Verify that the two are communicating.
1. Observe the electrical behavior of the bus line and the microcontroller lines.

Hint: The CAN callback is being called in an IRQ, and you should limit the time spent processing the data (printf isn't free!). Push the data onto a FreeRTOS queue and process in a thread.

## Activity
This activity will observe bus contention from a babbling node. "In a Controller Area Network a babbling node is a node continuously (and usually erroneously) transmitting CAN frames with identical - often high - priority."

1. Combine the send and receive code together, so each microcontroller does both.
1. On one board, broadcast messages with a high priority continuously.
1. On the other board, broadcast a message with a lower priority periodically.
1. Use oscilloscope to observe the access pattern.
1. Observe how often the lower priority message is actually transmitted and received.
1. Introduce a short busy wait delay into the babbling node, slowly increase the duration until you observe the other messages consistently received.
1. Document your observations in your repository.
